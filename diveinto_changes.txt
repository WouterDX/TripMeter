DOCTYPE: only one DOCTYPE needed in HTML5 = <!DOCTYPE html>

XHTML need not be explicitly declared in the root element (no <html xmlns=<SOURCE>>).
Also not necessary is a separate tag for the xml:lang:  in HTML5 YOU WANT IT TO BE THE SAME TAG.
    (if not, you get problems)

no type needed for stylesheet css

LESSONS LEARNT
**************
language attribute for <html> : this is useful when you provide your page in more than one language (and let the user choose)
it's also useful for cases where you let the user enter text (it will then be sure that the page supports right characters).

you either have a meta tag which defines your charset encoding (like utf-8), or you have a http header that defines it ("Content-Type: text/html; charset="utf-8").
always set something or else have security leak: http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleUtf7

important: the stylesheet link: <link rel="stylesheet" href={adress} />
